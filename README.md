The toString() method

MEETS SPECIFICATIONS

Any constants contained in the class are never modified, and are logical choices for constant values.

The submitted project consists of a single .java file, titled ReportCard.java, contained in a .zip file.

The class contains appropriate variables to track information which belongs on a report card. The class does not contain variables which should belong, for instance, to a student, a teacher, a school, or a textbook.

The class contains at least one constructor which properly instantiates each variable in the class.

Any private variables which might be read off of a report card should have a getter method to access them.

All private variables require a setter method.

The class contains a toString() method which returns the contents of the class in a human-readable string. The toString() method should properly use the @Override notation.
